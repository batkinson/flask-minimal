# Minimal Flask App

A minimal web application built in flask and using werkzeug.

## Why?

Primarily, this was developed as a motive for describing the inner workings of flask and werkzeug,
especially with regard to request and session handling.

## Requirements

To run this program, you'll need:

  * A working Python 3 environment with pip

## Setup

To run the program, you just need to install the dependencies. This should be
as simple as running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

To run the application, you just need to run the app.py file:

```
./app.py
```

This should start the application and make it availble at http://127.0.0.1:5000
